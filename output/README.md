# Semantically Encoding Activity Labels for Context-Aware Human Activity Recognition (SEAL)

This folder is intended to be empty. Output files will be stored under this folder automatically after training, each trainer will include:
- Lightning_logs (including tensorboard logs)
- Configuration files (including experiment_state.json, searcher_state.pkl, and search_gen_state.json)
- Trail directories for hyperparameter tuning (including checkpoints, metrics, and logs specific to that trail)
